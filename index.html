                My name is David Yuen. Graduated with a bachelor's in business administration and worked in 
                the financial industry for a few years. While working in the financial industry on my days off I
                would try to learn some coding, hiking around the bay area, and discovering new restaurants.

                 At the moment I am helping out a friend working at a veterinary emergency hospital and on Sunday 
                nights at a Japanese restaurant. Working at both these places taught me valuable skills in teamwork.

                Hobbies I love are traveling, photography and creating content of my travels.
